  "The Haab Calendar": 'The Haab is the Maya civil calendar, often referred to as the "vague year" due to its 365-day cycle. While it resembles the Gregorian calendar we use today, the Haab doesn’t account for leap years. This structure reflects the solar year and was crucial for organising agricultural and civic activities.<br></br>A year in the Haab is divided into 18 months, each containing 20 days. The months are named:<br></br>Pop, Wo, Sip, Sotz’, Sek, Xul, Yaxk’in, Mol, Ch’en, Yax, Sak’, Keh, Mak, K’ank’in, Muwan, Pax, K’ayab, and Kumk’u, followed by a short 5-day period called Wayeb.<br></br>These final 5 days were considered an ominous time when the boundaries between the mortal and spiritual worlds were more permeable, and people often avoided significant activities.<br></br>The Haab’s structure showcases the Maya’s advanced understanding of time. It not only marked practical events like planting seasons but also carried deep cultural and spiritual significance, reflecting their close relationship with the natural world. During Wayeb, rituals were often performed to protect individuals from misfortune, underscoring the spiritual weight of this calendar.',
  "The Tzolk'in Calendar": 'The Tzolk’in, or Sacred Calendar, was central to Maya culture and is still used in some Maya communities today. It consists of 260 days, derived from two interlocking cycles: a numerical cycle of 1–13 and a sequence of 20 named days. Each day was assigned a unique combination of number and name, with the full cycle repeating every 260 days. This structure can be thought of as two "weeks" running concurrently—one with numbers and one with names.<br></br>The 20 day names in the Tzolk’in are:<br></br>Imix, Ik’, Ak’bal, K’an, Chikchan, Kimi, Manik’, Lamat, Muluk, Ok, Chuwen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Kib, Kaban, Etz’nab, Kawak, and Ajaw.<br></br>Each glyph is enclosed within a “cartouche,” a circular frame often adorned with curls, symbolising the sacred nature of the day. These glyphs were intricately designed, reflecting the spiritual and artistic depth of the Maya.<br></br>The Tzolk’in guided spiritual and ceremonial life, determining auspicious days for events such as rituals, agricultural activities, and naming children. Each day carried profound symbolic meaning, influencing decisions and reinforcing the Maya belief in the interconnectedness of time, the cosmos, and human life.',
  "The Long Count Calendar": 'The Long Count Calendar was a linear system that tracked time from a specific starting point, the “creation date” of the current world, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar. Unlike the cyclical Tzolk’in and Haab, the Long Count allowed the Maya to measure extensive spans of time, crucial for recording historical events and predicting cosmic cycles.<br></br>This calendar divided time into units:<br></br>the k’in (1 day), the winal (20 days), the tun (360 days), the k’atun (7,200 days or 20 tuns), and the bak’tun (144,000 days or 20 k’atuns).<br></br>Dates were written in a hierarchical format, such as "12.19.4.1.8," representing each unit from largest to smallest. This precise system highlights the Maya’s mathematical ingenuity and their profound understanding of time.<br></br>The Long Count Calendar also held spiritual importance. Each cycle of creation was believed to have cosmic significance, with the completion of a bak’tun often marked by elaborate ceremonies. The calendar’s end date in 2012 inspired widespread interpretations, reflecting its enduring fascination in modern times.',
  "The Calendar Round": 'The Calendar Round combined the 260-day Tzolk’in and the 365-day Haab, creating a 52-year cycle. This period, known as the Calendar Round, marked the time it took for a specific date combination to reappear. Each date in the Calendar Round was expressed with four elements: the Tzolk’in day number, Tzolk’in day name, Haab day number, and Haab month name.<br></br>This system linked sacred and civil time, integrating spiritual beliefs with practical needs. For example, it was used to track agricultural cycles, ensuring alignment with seasonal changes, as well as to schedule rituals and festivals. The completion of a Calendar Round was celebrated with grand ceremonies, signifying the renewal of cosmic harmony.<br></br>By synchronising these two calendars, the Maya achieved an intricate understanding of time’s cyclical nature. The Calendar Round exemplifies their belief in the interconnectedness of the celestial and earthly realms, reinforcing the deep spiritual significance of their calendrical systems.',
  "The Lords Of The Night": 'Maya nights were ruled by nine “Lords of the Night,” deities who governed in a repeating cycle of nine nights. Each god had a unique glyph, symbolising their influence and character. These glyphs include:<br></br>G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, and G9.<br></br>The sequence was perpetual, creating a spiritual rhythm that mirrored the passage of time.<br></br>The Lords of the Night were believed to influence dreams, omens, and nocturnal rituals. Their presence imbued the night with spiritual depth, and ceremonies were often aligned with the ruling lord to ensure cosmic balance. Each deity’s traits and domains shaped how the Maya approached night time activities and spiritual practices.<br></br>This nightly cycle reflects the Maya’s broader world view, where time, the cosmos, and divine forces were deeply intertwined. The Lords of the Night serve as a testament to the Maya’s intricate cosmology, highlighting their belief in the harmony between earthly life and the divine.'
