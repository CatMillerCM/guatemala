# Mayan Calender Codex

Welcome to Guatemala's project: Mayan Calender Codex.

For this app, I really wanted to expand my knowldge on the Mayan Calendar systems, and deliver a fun way to learn and interact with the interesting glyphs and their meanings.

Even though several 'Mayan Calendar Converters' do already exist, mine adds a new layer in exposing the meaning behind the user's significant date's glyphs and allowing them to handily share the result. I also added a whole learning zone, detailing information about each calendar system and how they fit together to give the user more context.

Give it a go by entering a date that is important to you; whether it's a birthday, an anniversary, or even a future date that holds uncertainty. Let's see what the Mayans have to say about it!

For this project I did quite a lot of research and reading to further my understanding of the Mayans and their calendar systems, after hearing stories and speaking to locals on my travels.

However, I am not a professional researcher, nor was this the main objective of this project. Therefore, I do apologise if there are any inaccuracies or mistakes. I did lift and shift information from some trusted sources, which also make for great reading if you want to learn more. These were:
